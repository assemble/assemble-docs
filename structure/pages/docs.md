## Updates

* [Effeckt uses Assemble!](https://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css) - a h5bp project focused on "UI-less, performant transitions & animations". If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out, it's pretty awesome.
* [assemble-bootstrap](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-bootstrap) is a new boilerplate to build Twitter Bootstrap 3.0.0 with Assemble and Grunt.js. No need for Ruby, Jekyll, or running a server to view the docs. This repo is up-to-date and includes qunit and phantomjs tests.


## Common Questions

> Does Assemble have a CLI?

Not yet, but we're planning to introduce a number of new features in the next major version of Assemble. You are invited to [be a part of the planning process](https://github.com/assemble/refactor-planning).

> Does Assemble require Grunt? Can it be used without Grunt?

For the time being, yes, and no.

> What is the fastest way to learn how to use Assemble?

That depends on how you learn, but here are some really great starting points:

1. [assemble/buttons](https://github.com/assemble/buttons). We think this is the best place to start, since this project was created to be instructive. It demonstrates how Assemble works through a series of examples, where each example builds upon the last and, in general, adds something new that didn't exist in the previous example. The examples also begin very basic and increase in complexity over time.
1. [assemble/grunt-init-assemble](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-init-assemble). Grunt init template for Assemble, the static site generator built on Grunt.js. Kickstart new Assemble projects in just a few seconds, including templates, data, layouts, and a theme.
1. [assemble/generator-assemble](https://github.com/assemble/generator-assemble). Yeoman generator for Assemble, the static site generator built on Grunt.js. Kickstart new Assemble projects in just a few seconds, including templates, data, layouts, and a theme.
