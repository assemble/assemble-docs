# Pages

> Templates for static pages

_Pages_ should generally be viewed as scaffolding for other content or components.

Although pages may contain as much "content" as you want them to. However, the main purpose of pages should be to serve as:

* transitional vehicles. A vehicle transports something from A to B. Similarly our "page-as-a-vehicle" might be a Table of Contents, or photo gallery that should transport a visitor to another section of the website.
* containers for components, or includes
* "stencils" for content, which is actually written in other files (e.g. markdown files).

Also, if a _page_ is generalized enough that it could be used by multiple sections of a site, then it might make more sense to use the page as a [layout](../layouts) or a sub-layout instead.
