# Snippets

> Like includes, "snippets" are reusable fragments of code.

But snippets differ in that they may or may not be _included_ in other HTML. Examples:

* `feed.xml`: template used to generated RSS feeds.
* `heading.tmpl`: Lo-Dash/Underscore template used by [marked-extras](https://github.com/assemble/marked-extras) to generated heading IDs
