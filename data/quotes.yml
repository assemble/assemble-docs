    I feel like a super hero with @gruntjs and @assemblejs. Modularity + build process = win.

    Started using Assemble. Seems far better suited for static-site-generation on non-blog sites than Jekyll.

    What makes @assemblejs so powerful is its flexibility, which also made it a bit of a challenge to learn.

    What's great is, after you understand @gruntjs you can use @assemblejs to build whatever you want, however you want.

    Assemble is an awesome collection of task helpers, and it's up to you to enforce convention.

    I absolutely agree! Once I wrapped my head around it, @assemblejs was far and beyond the best tool of the bunch.
