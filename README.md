# assemble.io

> Website and documentation for [Assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble)

Branch v3.0 is a work in progress.

## Getting started

Download the documentation from GitHub, then install dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install && bower install
```

Next, try building the project with

```bash
grunt
```
In the very short term, while we're migrating the build process to use Assemble v0.5, _please don't create issues related to getting the build working for this branch_.  However, we encourage you to create issues or do pull requests related to actual documentation, or other things than can be improved with the site structure regardless of whether or not the build is working for you locally.

Thanks!
